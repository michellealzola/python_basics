### **Chapter 2: An Overview of Collections**

#### ðŸ“Œ **Collection Types**

---

### 1. **Linear Collections**

**Definition**: Linear collections store elements in a sequence. Examples include lists, stacks, and queues.

**Purpose**:

* Organize items in order.
* Useful when order and iteration are important.

**Examples (Manufacturing)**:

* A list of machines on the production line: `["Drill Press", "Lathe", "Milling Machine"]`
* A queue of maintenance requests: `["Replace filter", "Check motor", "Update software"]`
* A stack of tasks for a CNC machine: `["Calibrate", "Start Job", "Cool Down"]`

**Challenges**:

* Understanding mutability (lists can change, tuples canâ€™t).
* Choosing the right structure (e.g., when to use queue over list).

---

### 2. **Hierarchical Collections**

**Definition**: These represent parent-child relationships. Common examples: trees and nested dictionaries.

**Purpose**:

* Represent structured relationships.

**Examples (Manufacturing)**:

* A BOM (Bill of Materials):

```python
bom = {
    "Car": {
        "Engine": ["Piston", "Crankshaft"],
        "Chassis": ["Frame", "Wheels"]
    }
}
```

**Challenges**:

* Traversing nested structures.
* Implementing tree-like operations (e.g., finding depth or children).

---

### 3. **Graph Collections**

**Definition**: Graphs consist of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections). Useful for modeling relationships with paths and networks.

**Purpose**:

* Track dependencies, workflows, or connections.

**Examples (Manufacturing)**:

* Pipeline layout with valves and sensors as nodes.
* Transportation networks between plants.

```python
graph = {
    "Plant A": ["Warehouse", "Distribution Center"],
    "Warehouse": ["Plant B"]
}
```

**Challenges**:

* Implementing search algorithms (BFS, DFS).
* Representing weighted or directed graphs.

---

### 4. **Unordered Collections**

**Definition**: Collections where the order is not important, like sets and dictionaries.

**Purpose**:

* Fast lookup and uniqueness.

**Examples (Manufacturing)**:

* Set of unique fault codes: `{"E101", "E202", "E303"}`
* Dictionary of sensor readings:

```python
{"temp_sensor_1": 68.5, "pressure_valve_A": 120.0}
```

**Challenges**:

* Sets donâ€™t allow duplicates.
* Understanding hashability (unhashable types canâ€™t be keys).

---

### 5. **Sorted Collections**

**Definition**: Collections that maintain elements in a sorted order.

**Purpose**:

* Efficient searching and range-based queries.

**Examples (Manufacturing)**:

* Inventory levels by part ID sorted ascending.
* Quality scores sorted to detect outliers.

**Challenges**:

* Custom sort criteria (e.g., sorting by timestamps).
* Performance with large datasets.

---

### 6. **A Taxonomy of Collection Types**

**Definition**: A structured overview showing how different collections relate (e.g., linear vs. hierarchical).

**Purpose**:

* Helps choose the right data structure based on your needs.

**Examples (Manufacturing)**:

* Visual chart:

```text
Collection
â”œâ”€â”€ Linear (List, Queue, Stack)
â”œâ”€â”€ Hierarchical (Tree, Nested Dict)
â”œâ”€â”€ Graph
â”œâ”€â”€ Unordered (Set, Dict)
â””â”€â”€ Sorted (SortedList)
```

**Challenges**:

* Understanding trade-offs: speed vs memory, ordered vs unordered, mutable vs immutable.

## ðŸ”§ **Operations on Collections**

---

### 1. **Fundamental Operations on All Collection Types**

**Definition**:
Basic actions you can perform on any collection typeâ€”such as adding, removing, checking membership, and iterating over elements.

**Purpose**:
To manipulate data inside collections efficiently and consistently.

**Examples (Manufacturing)**:

| Operation  | Python Example              | Real-World Scenario               |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Add        | `machines.append("Welder")` | Add a new machine to the line.    |
| Remove     | `machines.remove("Lathe")`  | Decommission a machine.           |
| Membership | `"Sensor1" in sensors`      | Check if a sensor is active.      |
| Iterate    | `for part in parts:`        | Loop through components in a BOM. |

**Challenges**:

* Forgetting method names (`append()` vs `insert()`).
* Not handling missing elements safely (e.g., using `remove()` on an item not in the list).

---

### 2. **Type Conversion**

**Definition**:
Changing one collection type to another (e.g., list to set, tuple to list).

**Purpose**:

* Leverage specific collection features like ordering or uniqueness.
* Enable certain operations (e.g., sets can remove duplicates).

**Examples (Manufacturing)**:

```python
# Removing duplicate parts from a shipment
shipment = ["Bolt", "Bolt", "Nut", "Washer"]
unique_parts = list(set(shipment))
```

**Challenges**:

* Loss of data (e.g., order lost when converting to a set).
* Not understanding immutability (canâ€™t modify tuples after conversion from a list).

---

### 3. **Cloning and Equality**

**Definition**:

* *Cloning*: Making a copy of a collection.
* *Equality*: Comparing two collections for content (not just reference).

**Purpose**:

* Avoid unintentional changes to original data.
* Compare datasets accurately.

**Examples (Manufacturing)**:

```python
# Clone the current machine config
config_backup = current_config.copy()

# Compare two quality check lists
if qc_line1 == qc_line2:
    print("Identical checks performed")
```

**Challenges**:

* Confusing shallow vs deep copy.
* Using `==` vs `is`: `==` checks value; `is` checks memory reference.

---

### 4. **Iterators and Higher-Order Functions**

**Definition**:

* *Iterators*: Objects that allow traversal of a collection one item at a time.
* *Higher-Order Functions*: Functions that take other functions as input or return them.

**Purpose**:

* Powerful and reusable data processing.
* Lazy evaluation (e.g., reading a huge log file line by line).

**Examples (Manufacturing)**:

```python
# Iterator: loop over readings
for value in sensor_readings:
    process(value)

# Higher-order function: filter quality scores
def is_pass(score): return score >= 90
pass_scores = list(filter(is_pass, qc_scores))
```

**Challenges**:

* Syntax can feel abstract (especially `lambda`, `map`, `filter`).
* Understanding lazy evaluation and memory use.

## ðŸ§± **Implementations of Collections**

---

### **Definition**

In Python, *implementation* refers to how different collection types are built or customized. While Python provides built-in collections like `list`, `dict`, and `set`, you can also use specialized collection classes from the `collections` module or implement your own using classes.

---

### **Purpose**

* To create more efficient, tailored data structures.
* To extend or modify how standard collections behave.
* To manage complex real-world models (e.g., machine states, sensor buffers).

---

### **Real-World Manufacturing Examples**

#### âœ… **1. Built-in Implementations**

```python
# List to hold pressure readings
pressure_log = [101.2, 100.8, 102.3]

# Dict to represent machine status
machine_status = {
    "Drill Press": "Running",
    "CNC Lathe": "Maintenance",
    "Paint Booth": "Idle"
}
```

#### âœ… **2. Using `collections` Module**

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict, Counter

# deque for FIFO queue (sensor alerts)
alerts = deque(["TempHigh", "OilLow"])
alerts.append("SpeedDrop")
alerts.popleft()  # First-in alert is processed

# defaultdict for sensor data logging
from random import randint
sensor_log = defaultdict(list)
for i in range(5):
    sensor_log["Sensor_A"].append(randint(60, 100))

# Counter to count part defects
defects = Counter(["crack", "dent", "dent", "misalignment", "dent"])
# defects âžœ {'dent': 3, 'crack': 1, 'misalignment': 1}
```

#### âœ… **3. Custom Collection Classes**

```python
class PartLog:
    def __init__(self):
        self.records = []

    def add_part(self, part_id, timestamp):
        self.records.append((part_id, timestamp))

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.records)

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.records[index]
```

Used for storing logs from robotic arms or assembly line scans.

### **Challenges in Learning Implementations**

| Challenge                                                | Why It Happens                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Understanding class-based custom collections             | Requires object-oriented thinking                     |
| Choosing between built-in and `collections` module types | Can be overwhelming (e.g., list vs deque vs queue)    |
| Managing memory in large datasets                        | Understanding when to use generators or iterators     |
| Copying behavior                                         | `copy()` vs `deepcopy()` when nested structures exist |
